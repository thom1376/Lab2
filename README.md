# Lab2
This repository is for Lab 2 submission.


## 2.1 Activities and intents
This lab was all about learning about activities and intents. The project consisted of creating intents to send data between activities using the putExtra method of an intent. The data is sent through the intent from one activity to another, and then the other activity can respond by sending data back to the original activity.

### Issues and lessons
- No issues were encountered
- I learned how to create intents
- I learned what intents are used for
- I learned how to use explicit intents to start another activity
- I learned how to use intents to pass data to another activity
- I learned how to use intents to pass data back from another activity


## 2.2 Activity lifecycle and state
This lab was all about learning the lifecycle and states of an activity. The project consisted of overriding the callbacks invoked when an activity changes state. These methods were overridden to print to the log when they are called so the user knows when each callback runs and when the activity changes state, as well as to which state it changes.

### Issues and lessons
- No issues were encountered
- I learned the different callbacks
- I learned the different possible states of an activity
- I learned the triggers for each callback
- I learned when the activity changes states
- I learned which states the activity changes to and when


## 2.3 Implicit intents
This lab was all about implicit intents and what they are used for. The project consisted of creating two android projects, Implicit Intents and Implicit Intents Receiver, and creating implicit events on button click events, then handling the implicit intents through the other app.

### Issues and lessons
- There is an issue in the Implicit Intents Receiver project where the activity supporting ACTION_VIEW is not supported
- I learned how to define intent filters
- I learned what intent filters are
- I learned how intent filters can be used to allow apps to handle specific implicit intents
- I learned how to create implicit intents
- I learned how to filter intents based on the data contained in them


## Android Basics Lesson 1
This lab consisted of going through lesson 1 of the Udacity course, Android Basics - User interface. This lesson explored views, what they are, how to use them, and some view properties.

### Issues and lessons
- No issues were encountered
- I learned what a view is
- I learned different types of views
- I learned the situations in which to use specific views
- I learned some view properties


## Android Basics Lesson 2
This lab consisted of going through lesson 2 of the Udacity course, Android Basics - User Interface. This lesson explored view groups, what they are, how to use them, and some properties of view groups.

### Issues and lessons
- No issues were encountered
- I learned what view groups are
- I learned the different types of view groups
- I learned which view groups are better suited for different scenarios
- I learned some properties of view groups


## Android Basics Lesson 3
This lab consisted of going through lesson 3 of the Udacity course, Android Basics - User Interface. This lesson was to practice what was learned in the previous lessons. This lesson consisted of creating a birthday card app to showcase view groups, views, and their properties.

### Issues and lessons
- No issues were encountered
- I learned when to use a relative layout
- I learned how to style text
- I learned how to style images
- I learned how to change the order views are drawn
- I learned why the order views are drawn in is important
